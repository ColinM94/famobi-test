All my code is inside the "src" folder. There is a GameDetails screen even though it wasn't requested, I thought it would be cool to add it.
You can click any of the games to see it. You can combine multiple filters and sorting at the same time. ( eg. sort alphabetically and filter by category)

To run this project locally and view the code, these programs and packages are required:

-   VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
-   Node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/
-   Expo CLI: run "npm install -g expo-cli"

1. Download the project from GitHub.
2. Unzip it.
3. Open a terminal in the root directory.
4. Run "npm install" to download all the required packages.
5. Run "expo start"
6. Press "D" in the terminal to bring up the Expo menu in your browser.
7. Connect an Android or IOS device to the same network as the computer or open an emulator.
8. Run it on a device or an emulator.
    - Expo (Android App): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en&gl=US
    - Expo Go (IOS App): https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779
9. Running the app locally always gives me bad performance, the published version here will show the actual performance of the app.
